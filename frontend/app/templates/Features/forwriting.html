                    <p class="text-muted">TecDocs gives you two simple ways to share your work with collaborators: via
                        private invitation or by providing a link. By default, every document you produce there is
                        private.
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        You can distribute your creations by using secure connections with link sharing. Simply enable
                        link sharing, send your co-authors the link, and they may read, comment on, and edit. You might
                        also just disable the link to make your project private once more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        With private invitations, you can give access to your projects to a limited number of named
                        collaborators; the number of named collaborators you can invite for each project depends on your
                        plan. View the plans and costs at TecDocs..</p>

                        switch to the rich text mode of TecDocs, which produces headlines, pictures, formatting, and
                        equations right in the editor.
