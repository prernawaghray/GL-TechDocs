    <p>You can invite named collaborators to your project via the ‘share’ menu in your project (with read-only or edit
        access). Simply add their email address and an email invitation will be sent to them. You can remove these named
        collaborators at any time via the same ‘share’ menu. The number of named collaborators you can invite depends on
        your plan.

    <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Account_and_project_level_features">Account and project level features</span></h3>
    <p>Please note that certain premium features apply at the <b>project level</b>, like track-changes, compile time,
        and access to full history, and are based on the project owner's subscription. So, when invited to collaborate
        on a project owned by a someone with a subscription, users on the free plan can use those features within that
        project.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, if you yourself have an upgraded account, your fellow collaborators do not need to pay for a
        subscription in order to use track-changes or access the full history within projects that you share with them.
    </p>
    <p>Other premium features apply at the <b>account level</b>, and are controlled by you, the subscription holder.
        These are the features which include linking to external services, like Dropbox, GitHub, Git, Mendeley, and
        Zotero. The majority of these do also confer benefits to those you work with, as described below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>GitHub:</b> A user with a premium subscription can link any project they own to a GitHub repo. Once the
            project is linked, all users in the project can click the button to sync it. So this can be thought of as a
            'per project' feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Git:</b> If the project is owned by a user with a premium subscription, all members of the project can
            git clone/push/pull to it. If a user has a premium subscription, they can git clone/push/pull to all
            projects they have access to. This is like a superset of GitHub and Dropbox permission model - it's
            personal, and per project.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Symbol Palette:</b> A user with a premium subscription always has access to this feature regardless of
            which project they are working on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To find out more about how to use these premium features, please see the <i>Read More</i> links in the sections
        above.
